## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate gamer who started his game development journey while playing games, when a sudden thought came to my mind:

> *"I have played lots of games and I know what makes a game better.  
If I were making games, then definitely I could make better games."*

With this thought, I started digging into game development.  
I didn’t come from a technical background like BCA, Computer Science, or BTech — but I never stopped learning.

I learned programming and computer fundamentals from scratch, explored Unity deeply, and eventually realized that **gameplay programming** is my strongest area.

For more than **1+ year**, I’ve been focused on writing clean, scalable, production-ready code and preparing myself to be industry-ready.
